/*
*  First of all You shuld add your configuration(PostgreSQL) for connection to DB
*  Mock data will be added to the database with FlyWay
*  
*  This Bot has answer for next question:
*  Who is head of department {department_name}
*  Show {department_name} statistics.
*  Show the average salary for the department {department_name}.
*  Show count of employees for {department_name}.
*  Global search by {template}.
*
*  In 4-th question I added “s” to word “employees”.
*
*  I don't know if ".” should be at the end of
*  sentences or not, or somewhere should be “?”, that's why I included all the variants.
